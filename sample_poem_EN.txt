The Beauty of Nature

Prologue
A beautiful natural scene spread out before my eyes.
      
The scent of grass rides the breeze
Trees whisper softly
Mountains watch in silence
     
Chapter 1 
Morning Light
        
The morning sun dyes the eastern sky
A single ray lights up the forest
Birds exchange their songs
The stream murmurs quietly   
        
In that light
Wildflowers awaken
The breath of life
Quietly, yet surely, begins to fill the world
