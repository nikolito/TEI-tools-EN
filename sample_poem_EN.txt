The Beauty of Nature

Prologue
A beautiful natural scene spread out before my eyes.

The scent of grass rides the breeze
Trees whisper softly
Mountains watch in silence

Chapter 1: Morning Light
The morning sun dyes the eastern sky
A single ray of light illuminates the forest
Birds exchange chirps
A stream murmurs quietly

In that light
Wildflowers awaken
The breath of life
Silently—yet surely—fills the air
